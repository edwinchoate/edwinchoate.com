I enjoy making logos for friends and/or school projects. These are some of my favorites. If you'd like me to make _you_ a logo, don't hesitate to shoot me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }})!

<div class="logo">
<img id="brad-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="brad ware logo" src="/img/logos/bw_logo.png">
</div>

As my friend [Brad Ware](https://www.facebook.com/bradwhere) and I embarked on creating our own [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) sites, he noticed I was into the whole "logo thing". So, I made him this one for his site. You can see it live at [bradware.com](http://www.bradware.com/).

<div class="logo">
<img id="quikalarm-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="quikalarm logo" src="/img/logos/quikalarm_logo.png">
</div>

A logo design for _Quikalarm_, a fictitious alarm clock app that focuses on convenience and modernism.

<div class="logo">
<img id="harney-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="harney logo" src="/img/logos/harney_logo.png">
</div>

My friend [Zach Harney](https://www.facebook.com/zach.harney.14), a business major at [Tech](https://gatech.edu), wanted a logo just for kicks. I'm not sure if he's used it for anything to be honest.

<div class="logo">
<img id="miller-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="alex miller logo" src="/img/logos/miller_logo.png">
</div>

My friend [Alex Miller](https://www.facebook.com/amiller611) is working on his Ph.D. in rocket science. He doesn't have a whole lot of free time, but when he gets around to it, this will be the logo for his website. He's red-green colorblind so for convenience' sake, he hopes to create his personal site, [alexmiller.ninja](http://www.alexmiller.ninja/), in 100% greyscale.

<div class="logo">
<img id="acf-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="ACF logo" src="/img/logos/acf_logo.png">
</div>

A logo design for the Apostles College Fellowship, based out of [The Church of the Apostles](http://apostles.org/) in Atlanta, GA. I worked with Apostles' College Coordinator to create a logo that includes both traditional and modern elements.

<div class="logo">
<img id="mandledwin-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="mandledwin logo" src="/img/logos/mandledwin_logo.png">
</div>

The logo for my folk playlist, [Mandledwin](http://mandledwin.blogspot.com/). Hand-drawn + Photoshop. You can check out the YouTube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYfruQNkALE5INs6ZP2BaChWZCkKvGXGr) or give it a [listen](https://play.spotify.com/user/ed_46/playlist/0hkYHEeCSbH2e1huVK1Bpb) on Spotify.

<div class="logo">
<img id="offseason-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="off season logo" src="/img/logos/offseason_logo.png">
</div>

The main logo for my GameBoy Advance game, [Off Season]({{ site.url }}/offseason/). This logo was designed to display in 4-bit color. The challenge was to create a logo full of color that also showed depth in just 16 pixels by 16 pixels.

<div class="logo">
<img id="sunrise-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="sunrise logo" src="/img/logos/sunrise_logo.png">
</div>

A logo I designed for a poster in my bedroom that represents a rising sun. It is inspired by the [Criterion Collection](https://www.criterion.com/) logo animation which you can catch at the beginning of [this video](https://youtu.be/q33FVqRlWCo).

<div class="logo">
<img id="old-ec-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="old site logo" src="/img/logos/old_site_logo.png">
</div>

The main logo for an earlier version of this site.

<div class="logo">
<img id="ec-logo" class="margin-top-responsive margin-bottom-responsive" alt="current site logo" src="/img/ec_logo.png">
</div>

My personal logo and the de facto logo for this site. It abstractly represents my initials, E.C. and uses some of my favorite colors.
