                <h1>About Edwin Choate</h1>
                <p>I'm a <abbr title="user experience">UX</abbr> Designer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncr.com/">NCR Corporation</a> in Atlanta, GA. Within the realm of UX, I am especially interested in usability, information architecture, wireframing, and prototyping. I'm also passionate about things like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.humanetech.com/">humane technology</a> and issues such as misinformation on the internet and data privacy. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, listening to <a target="_blank" href="https://folkalley.com/">folk & americana music</a>, retro 8-bit video games, learning new things, and playing my acoustic guitar.</p>
