                <h1>About Edwin Choate</h1>
                <p>I'm a <a title="What is UX design?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design">user experience (UX) designer</a> at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.taxslayer.com/">TaxSlayer</a> and I'm based out of Atlanta, GA. Within the realm of UX, I am especially interested in usability, information architecture, wireframing, and prototyping. I'm also passionate about things like <a title="Center for Humane Technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.humanetech.com/">humane technology</a> and issues such as misinformation on the internet and data privacy. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, listening to <a title="Folk Alley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://folkalley.com/">folk & americana music</a>, retro 8-bit video games, and playing my acoustic guitar.</p>
