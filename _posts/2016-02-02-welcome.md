First and foremost, thanks for reading!

Secondly, I would like to establish that my target audience with this blog is primarily techies.

This post marks the completion of [version 2.0](https://github.com/edwinchoate/edwinchoate.github.io/releases/tag/v2.0) of my site. It's been a pleasure to create thus far. In this post, I'll be explaining _how_ I built this version of my site.

This is my first project after my recent switch to [Atom](https://atom.io/), and I've got to say... I like it. As I expected, the [Github](https://github.com/) integration is fantastic.

I've been hosting my website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a couple years now, so I've become aware of some of the technology it uses. (If you haven't heard of Github Pages, I would _highly_ recommend you [check it out](https://pages.github.com/).) Github Pages uses a tool called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for static site generation.

Jekyll is great across the board. It keeps your files [relatively] organized, has native [Sass partials](http://sass-lang.com/guide) and [mixins](http://sass-lang.com/guide) available right out of the box, provides quick and easy templating via the [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) rendering engine, and has built-in RSS which makes it blog-aware. On top of all that, Jekyll is built with native HTML and CSS so you can build virtually anything you want.

With Jekyll, you can write blog posts (like this one) in Github-esque markdown, which is super nice. All you have to do is add a little bit of [YAML](http://yaml.org/) to the top of the file. It's really simple, and it's great for getting a blog post up quickly.  

If you would like to give Jekyll a try, you can get rolling with three simple commands:

{% highlight bash %}
edwinchoate:~ ☕️  gem install jekyll
edwinchoate:~ ☕️  jekyll new .
edwinchoate:~ ☕️  jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Browse to http://localhost:4000 and voilà! You've got a Jekyll site running locally.

I started site building by reconstructing the default Jekyll navbar. I essentially scrapped it and built my own in its place. I built my new navbar almost entirely using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), using the navbar from [creative.mailchimp.com](http://creative.mailchimp.com/) as my guide (it's one of my favorite navbars).

After that, I quickly ramped up, creating all of the top-level pages of my site. I knew I wanted to bring over the [Off Season](http://www.edwinchoate.com/offseason/) and [logo](http://www.edwinchoate.com/logos/) pages from my old site, but I decide to discontinue the others. I wanted to reduce as much [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) as possible, so I moved my hand-coded music page to a SoundCloud profile, which [edwinchoate.com/music](http://edwinchoate.com/music/) now redirects to.

As always, I trust [Bower](http://bower.io/) with most of my package management. As soon as I initialized my Jekyll site, I immediately "bower installed" a few fundamental dependencies like:

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - for responsive layouts
- [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) - for cool vectorized icons
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - for simple animation and interaction

The last piece of the puzzle was to find a better syntax highlighting tool. I say _better_ because Jekyll does provide one, but I don't think that it's that good. After a surprisingly small amount of research, I found my answer: [prismjs](http://prismjs.com/). I'm using the "Okaidia" theme, which looks a lot like [Sublime Text's](https://www.sublimetext.com/) default highlighting theme. I was quite pleased with this find.

I'm looking forward to using this blog to share cool tools, ideas, and experiences. Feel free to [subscribe via RSS!](http://www.edwinchoate.com/feed.xml)

Till next time,

Edwin
